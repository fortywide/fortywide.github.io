    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm Ed Balasingham, the creator behind this space. I currently reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. I attend Piedmont High School and Laney Community College. This website serves as a platform for me to share my thoughts, projects, and insights on various topics related to software, hardware, and more. When I am not busy with school, I am usually making something, whether it be for robotics, work, or personal projects.</p>
