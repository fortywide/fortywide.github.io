## What is the most optimal way to get hacked?

The first thing you need to do is make sure all of your passwords are the exact same with no changes whatsoever. The second step is to make sure all of your disks are unencrypted and the user account has root access (same password as before of course). Make sure to use 2fa through  either google authenticator, or through a physical security key, but most importantly, keep the recovery codes in plain text in your desktop folder. Last but not least, fall for a scam but don't realize what happened for 3 days until you try to log in to microsoft and it says there isn't a account with that email. RUH ROH.
